# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*

The application I created gathered data from two different free APIs to get data concerning weather alerts in user-inputed zip codes of National Football League games.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
This is nowhere near complete. My application was intended to gather data from both APIs, not just one, and its meaningful result is not completed either. My application was supposed to create a series of drop down windows and search buttons with events connected to keybinds, then when a user inputed NFL team is entered with the zipcode, the weather forecast and any possible weather alerts for the stadium would be displayed on the screen. My display was also supposed to be more colorful. 

## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
Json, pygame and requests were all used (or supposed tobe implemented)

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*

Even though I was given a week to complete this, I still had so many different assignments and finals I had to try to fit in to study for that I was unable to put anywhere near my best effort and work into this final exam.
